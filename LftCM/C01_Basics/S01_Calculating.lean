1. Commutative Law of Multiplication (mul_comm): a √ó b = b √ó a

  The commutative law for multiplication states that
  for any two numbers ùëé and ùëè,
  the order in which you multiply them does not matter.

2. Associative Law of Multiplication (mul_assoc): (a √ó b) √ó c = a √ó (b √ó c)

  The associative law for multiplication states that
  when multiplying three or more numbers,
  the way in which the numbers are grouped does not affect the result.

  ring

/-
In Lean, when we are asked to prove an equality
without providing any arguments,
we can use tactics that don't require specifying particular lemmas or
theorems. The ring tactic is perfect for this situation.
It automatically proves equalities involving ring operations
(addition and multiplication) by normalizing both sides
and checking for equality.

example (a b c : ‚Ñù) : a * (b * c) = b * (a * c) := by
  rw [mul_left_comm]

/-
mul_left_comm perfectly matches your goal,
allowing Lean to rewrite the left-hand side to the right-hand side directly.

    simp

/-
1. Using simp:
  A powerful tactic for simplifying goals using
  a vast library of simplification lemmas.

2. Using ring:
  Ideal for equalities involving ring operations;
  it can handle more complex algebraic expressions.

3. Understanding sub_self:
  Knowing basic lemmas like sub_self can help conclude proofs
  when you have expressions like x - x = 0.
  Here: exact sub_self (a * b)

4. Finishing with rfl:
  When the goal simplifies to 0 = 0 or any x = x,
  rfl can conclude the proof.
  Here:
    rw [sub_self (a * b)] -- Now ‚ä¢ 0 = 0

  We're trying to prove that c = ... given the hypotheses c = ... and b = ...
  We achieve this by substituting b into the equation,
  rewriting terms using commutative and associative properties,
  and simplifying the result.
